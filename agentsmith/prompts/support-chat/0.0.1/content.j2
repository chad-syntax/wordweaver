Q: What is Agentsmith?
A: Agentsmith is an Open-Source AI Agent development platform built for developers to author and manage their prompts and agents.

Q: How does Agentsmith Work?
A: Agentsmith connects to your GitHub and OpenRouter accounts, allowing you to author and test prompts in our web studio while syncing all data to your GitHub repository for fast prompt compilation on production.

Q: Do I need an OpenRouter account to use Agentsmith?
A: An Openrouter account is required if you execute prompts via Agentsmith. You can use Agentsmith to author and sync prompts to your GitHub repository without connecting to OpenRouter.

Q: How much does it cost to run agents?
A: The cost of running agents entirely depends on the amount of tokens the agent consumes, and the price per token on the model. See https://openrouter.ai/models for further pricing details.

A: Agentsmith streamlines AI agent development with intuitive prompt authoring for all skill levels, robust testing capabilities, seamless Git integration for version control, and typesafe SDKs (TypeScript & Python). This means you can build, refine, and deploy more reliable AI agents, faster.

Q: Is Agentsmith suitable if I'm not an expert developer?
A: Absolutely! Agentsmith is designed with an intuitive interface for prompt engineering, making it accessible for both technical and non-technical users. You can craft and manage sophisticated AI prompts without deep coding knowledge.

Q: How does Agentsmith fit into my existing development workflow?
A: Agentsmith integrates smoothly with your current setup. You can synchronize prompt versions directly to your Git repository via Pull Requests, ensuring version control and team collaboration. Our typesafe SDKs for TypeScript and Python allow for confident integration into your applications.

Q: Can I use different AI models or switch providers with Agentsmith?
A: Yes, Agentsmith supports provider switching through OpenRouter. This gives you the flexibility to choose the best AI models for your needs and optimize costs without being locked into a single provider.
